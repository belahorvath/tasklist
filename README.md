# Tasklist 
## About
While studying computer science we practice a lot of diffrent programming languages with different examples. This tasklist was one of them! WHile the semester was going on, we were able to use the API of the course which is now no longer available. Due to this change i decided to create my own API and DB with diffrent features and a userlogin with OAuth and PassPort.js!
_Enjoy_

## This tasklist uses a few things
1. Bootstrap
2. Jquery (Datepicker)
3. Riot.js (Tags aswell as event cycle)
4. Node.js (Backend with modules)
5. MySql database (locally installed and maybe updated to sqlLite or a hosted DB)
6. User logins (Work in progress)
7. PassPort.js and OAuth (Work in progress)
